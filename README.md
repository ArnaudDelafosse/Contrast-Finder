# Asqatasun Contrast-Finder

Tool to provide color combination for a good (accessible, WCAG-compliant) contrast.


## Why another contrast tool ?

Just to **provide contrast solutions** !

All tools just tell you whether the contrast is good or not, which is fine... 
but insufficient. Webdesigners / webdevelopers need to easily have a good contrast. 
That's the purpose of Contrast-Finder
